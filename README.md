opendev
=======

HTML/CSS/JS code to create an 'open development' web-page from a GitHub repository, using the GitHub API.  

Inspired by the [Google DevArt]('https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/16992761') competition format where entrants keep a development diary of their project via commits and posts formatted as markdown documents. These posts are automatically retreived and formatted into a nice timeline view, complete with images, videos, and links. I would like to take this principle further and utilise the extended descriptions of commit messages as further 'mini-posts'. Of course, not every commit will be noteworthy, so we'll think of someway of excluding posts manually.

The open development process is something that we've always aspired to, but never got round to doing. Currently, when we finish a big project, we try to do a write-up about how it was put together after the fact. The problems with this are numerous - sometimes we don't get round to it because of other work, sometimes we ourselves forget how we actually did something, and often it's both.  

I will be writing this code with the intention of hosting it on a part of the Reactify website (e.g. reactifymusic.com/opendev), and may therefore look into turning this into a WordPress plug-in.

Caveat: I am not a trained web-developer however I can hack things together and they usually work. The code written here won't be pristine, but it will hopefully be useful.
